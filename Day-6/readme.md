# 1) what is javascript?
-> JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility.
# 2) difference between var and let
1-> var is only limited to the function where it is declared.whereas let is only available inside the {} block where it is declared.

2-> var allows re-declaring the same variable in the same scope and let does not allow re-declaring the same variable in the same scope.
# 3) Why do we prefer const over var?

-> We prefer const over var because const helps prevent unintended changes to variables, leading to safer, more predictable code
# 4) What is the use of javascript in web browsers?
-> JavaScript is used in web browsers to make websites interactive, dynamic, and responsive. Without JavaScript, websites would be just static pages with no animations, buttons, or real-time updates.
# 5) What are Objects?
->In JavaScript, objects are used to store multiple related values in a single variable. They are like containers that hold properties (key-value pairs).
we use objects due to-
Store complex data in one place
Easier to organize and manage data
Used in real-world applications 
# 6) What is an array and how is it different from an Object in Javascript?
-> Arrays are used when we need to collection a list of elements of the same data type or structure. On the other hand, objects are used when grouping multiple sets of data that belong together using labels, where each property or key has its own value of any type.
# 7) What is a function?
-> a function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task, taking input (parameters) and potentially returning an output.
# 8)How can we implement call by value and call by reference in Javascript?
->
call by value-In this method, values of actual parameters are copied to the functionâ€™s formal parameters, and the two types of parameters are stored in different memory locations. So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller
Call by reference- If an object is stored in a variable and that variable is made equal to another variable then both of them occupy the same location in memory. Changes in one object variable affect the other object variable.
# 9) What are the primitive data types in Javascript?
-> In JavaScript, primitive data types are the most basic types of data. They are immutable (cannot be changed) and stored directly in memory.
There are 7 primitive data types:
string.
number.
bigint.
boolean.
undefined.
symbol.
null.
# 10) What is DOM?
-> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects. It allows JavaScript to dynamically interact with and manipulate web pages.
# 11) Why do we need DOM?
-> The DOM (Document Object Model) is essential because it allows JavaScript to interact with, modify, and control web pages dynamically. Without the DOM, web pages would be static and unchangeable after loading.
