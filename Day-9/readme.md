### 1. What is NodeJS?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is designed for building scalable, high-performance applications, particularly web servers and real-time applications.

### 2. What is V8 Engine
The V8 Engine is also a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It powers:

Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

Node.js, allowing JavaScript to run on servers.

Fast execution by compiling JavaScript into machine code instead of interpreting it.

### 3. What is Event Loop in NodeJS
The Event Loop in Node.js is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations and executes JavaScript code non-blockingly. It allows Node.js to perform I/O operations (like reading files, handling HTTP requests, etc.) without blocking the execution of other code.

### 4. What is the use of tsconfig.json file?
The tsconfig.json file is used in TypeScript projects to configure how the TypeScript compiler (tsc) behaves. It allows developers to specify compiler options, project settings, and file inclusions/exclusions in a structured way.

### 5. What are the methods provided by `fs` module to manipulate files
The fs (File System) module in Node.js provides various methods to manipulate files, including reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. These methods come in synchronous, asynchronous (callback-based), and promise-based (fs.promises) versions.

### 6. What is API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge that enables one application to request and receive data or functionality from another.

### 7. What is JSON format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for storing and exchanging data between a server and a web application.

### 8. Why we use JSON format for API?
JSON is widely used for APIs because it is lightweight, human-readable, and easy to parse

### 9. What is a Framework
A framework is a pre-built collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that help developers build applications efficiently. It provides a structured way to develop software, reducing the need to write repetitive code from scratch.

### 10. How an HTTP Communication works.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the web. It defines how clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers communicate over the internet.

### 11. What is Middleware in ExpressJS
Middleware in Express.js is a function that sits between the request and response cycle. It can modify the request, process data, and control the flow of an Express application.
